Files

multidimensionalObjective: describes a noise-free objective in R**8
incompleteCholesky: approximates a Cholesky decomposition
LLTSolver: Solves a system of linear equations (L @ L.T)*y=r for y using forward and backward substitution
Check00: run this to check your setup

---
Tasks
---
1. Set up your Python environment and run Check00.py to check your setup.
2. The script needs to run without error messages.
3. You do not need to return a file in LAB00 yet.

Hints
---
Look into incompleteCholesky and LLTSolver to get some ideas how algorithm control structures could be used in python.
